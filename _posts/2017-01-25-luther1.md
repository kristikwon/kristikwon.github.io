Blog Post 3: Project 2.0. Project Luther: Prologue

Learning goal: using data we scrape from the web, build linear regression models from which we can learn about wine.

Objective: Predict the price of wine given set of features

Wine! For some reason, I didn’t even consider other options and decided to go with wine. By no means am I a wine expert, so… don’t ask why I picked this topic haha
So naturally, before I could begin webscraping, I needed to do some research on wine.

What are different types of wines? What were some features that affect the taste and quality of wine? How do I measure a quality of a wine? 

Here are some things are learned about wine, and assumptions I have made to select my parameters:

1. **Wine Type** For sake of modeling, I decided to get a [list](http://www.ibtimes.com/what-are-most-popular-wine-grapes-world-1540272) of 10 most popular wines. But I later cut down the category to 6, by grouping them by taste notes. These are the 10 wines grouped into 6 categories: <img src="/assets/images/wine_types_grouped.PNG"> I give all credit to [winefolly](http://winefolly.com/) because by no means am I an expert at this! Otherwise I would be a notable wine critic, not a data scientist haha  
2. **Region** In many sources that I have read through, it was mentioned repeatedly how region was an important factor. This made sense since region is a determining factor for weather, types of grapes grown, and when the fruit is harvested. I got information on region from wine-searcher.com. I also grouped these into a limited number, by geographical locations: US, France - Italy, Spain - Portugal, Australia - New Zealand, Chile - Peru - Columbia. Other countries that were not one of the mentioned above were dropped.  
3. **Score** One of the most interesting data I discovered from [wine-searcher](http://wine-searcher.com) was “average score” metrics. This was the average score given by influential wine critics on 100 point scale. This data is not easy to come by, so I felt very fortunate. However, I did have to make an assumption that these scores were not affected by price.  
4. **Weather** Specifying weather parameter was rather tricky. I made an assumption that harvest season affects the grape quality the most, as it is when sugar level, acidity, and water content is determined. Typically, “harvest season” spanned through multiple months, but I picked one month. Even so, I had to do some more digging because harvest months were different for every wine types and whether the grape was grown in the northern hemisphere or the southern hemisphere. Now once I had the specific month that I was interested in, I decided to get monthly average temperature and total precipitation. So for example, for a 2007 vintage cabernet sauvignon from Napa, I would look for weather information in October 2007, since cabernets in the northern hemisphere are typically harvested in October and November.  
5. **Economic Health** One parameter that is least connected with wine that I included was the [annual US GDP](http://www.multpl.com/us-gdp-inflation-adjusted/table?f=m). My presumption was that when economy is strong, people will have more room for spending on essential items such as wine (though some people may disagree on that point). On the side note: US was the biggest wine consuming country in volume in 2015!
