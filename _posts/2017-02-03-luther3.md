**Pre-Modeling**

I began by looking at what the price data looked like, and this was what I got:
<img src="/assets/images/wine_type_by_price.png">
This is the plot of price of all the wine data I have, sorted in ascending order. Clearly, wine prices are not incrementing in linear succession. To account for this, I used logarithmic transformation on price. Secondly, I also noticed how some of the wine types are clustered. The points that shoot up on price on the far right side of the graph are generally dominated by pinks; when I looked into these, they were mostly pinot noirs. I couldâ€™ve set a threshold on maximum wine price, but I decided to keep all of my data points since there seemed to be some kind of pattern to this which could contribute to getting some meaningful results.

My final clean dataset with all non-missing variables were the following:
Outcome variable: log-price
Features: average score, monthly mean temperature (fahrenheit), monthly total precipitation (inches), annual adjusted US GDP (Trillion USD), dummy/binary variables of regional categories, dummy/binary variables of wine types


-train test split, test_size = 0.3

robust scaler and transformed X_train and X_test
Tried Linear, LASSO, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Gradient Boosting seemed to fit the best, but used randomized searchCV to find the best coins.

-DO randomized search for Gradient Boosting to test/tune multiple parameters (n_estimators, min_samples_leaf, max_features. Set subsample, learning_rate)
-select the model with the best mean accuracy: 0.732

Main-Takeaways:
Result (1/4)
- critics have good palates!
- steady-states: "poor" wines are all the same; "outstanding" wines are all the same
- large gap between "great" and "outstanding" wines. 

Result (2/4)
- Not too cold, not too hot please!
- lower temperature generally better
- caveat: mean temperature over a month. does not account for range of temperature difference from day and night
- precipitation: little to no effect. might be an artifact of lack of data

Result (3/4)
- wine types (categorized) have less effect than region. Most likely because regions determine various factors including weather, types of wine produced. It may even influence some people's opinion about wine because some regions are better known for producing "good" wines than others
- France in its own league

Result (4/4)
- Contrary to what I expected to see, wine price actually went down as GDP increased. GDP variable is probably acting as a proxy for wine age, which tells us that older wines are generally more expensive than younger ones. I purposely did not include age in the model because I was afraid it might create bias toward favoring older wines; for example, if an older wine is better, then a 2016 wine (most recent wine data I have) would always be cheaper than older wines even though it may be an equally qualifying bottle in the next decade.


Final word before I close this case...
