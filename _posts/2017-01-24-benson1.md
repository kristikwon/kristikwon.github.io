**Week 1. Group Project 1.**

**Data**

- MTA Data

**Tools Used**

- python and pandas
- visualizations via Matplotlib and seaborn

**Project Proposal:**
Lt. Olivia Benson has retired from the NYPD and has opened a new restaurant named: Benson's Falafel. The restaurant is in New York City, in the famous Hell's Kitchen district. Benson is looking to expand into the food truck business for dinner time only in the same neighborhood. Company leased a truck for a 3 month period (February - April) to test the profitability as well as advertise for the brick and mortar restaurant. Benson wants to target weekday local customers who live in the neighborhood. The goal is to create a regular base of customers and expand the business.

*******

**Parameters:**

- Most recent 3 months of MTA data in February - April 2016
- Stations located near a single district: Hell's Kitchen (66 ST-LINCOLN, 59 ST COLUMBUS, 57 ST, 7 AV, 50 ST, 49 ST, 42 ST-PORT AUTH, TIMES SQ-42 ST, 34 ST-PENN STA, 34 ST-HUDSON YD)
- Entries/exits during the evening: 4-10pm
- Weekday travels to target local residents, not travelers who are unlikely to come back

**Approach & Data Cleaning:**
MTA data was at turnstile level, where each data "stints" was represented by unique C/A (control area), UNIT (remote unit for a station), SCP (subunit channel position, representing a specific address for a device), and STATION (station name). And each of these turnstiles had information on the date and time of the audit, linename, division, and cumulative count of entries and exits. Since we were interested in identifying stations and their corresponding exit counts, we ultimately grouped by station level. However, before we made such a transition, as may data-related projects go, majority of the time was spent inspecting and cleaning the data. Here are some examples:

- Dropped duplicates (which were incorrect AUD entries. We also restricted the values to "regular" scheduled audit events)
- Since each row of data represented the cumulative counts of exits, we calculated the incremental values. However, for those that had negative increments, we 0-ed them out.
- While most of the time blocks between each stints were 4 hours, this was not always the case (of course! I should not be surprised). So we calculated the incremental exits per station time point and normalized per hour.
- Removed entries with incremental exits over a threshold of 50,000.
- Number of exits for a station on a particular day was calculated as the average exits/hour since multiple time blocks might be included in the dinner time (4-10pm)

**Results:**
To identify the top 5 stations with the most exits, we ploted time-series data for the average number of riders over the course of 3 months.

The top plot highlights the 5 stations with the highest number of riderships, and bottom plot highlights the remaining 5 stations.

Now that we have identified the 5 stations, the next goal was to assign each of them to single day of the week. Even though the first plot seems to suggest that the average exits are periodical, we started off by examining how the values fluctuated each week because we needed to represent these ranges of values to a single value. (We have multiple data points for Monday. So which Monday value can we use to represent 66 ST-LINCOLN's Monday?)

Each line above represents each week. While the daily exits have pretty consistent patterns (increasing ridership from Monday through Friday, and drop on weekends), there are definitely some random blips. To account for this noise, we decided to use the median of these values to summarize a station's day. 

We are ready for assigning 5 stations to a specific day of the week! We priorized stations by size: first, we ordered stations by size, then assigned a station to an unoccupied day with most exits. (Side comment: We could have chosen stations with the largest exits for all days of the week (Benson can park at a single station multiple times in a week), but we wanted to avoid this because we also wanted to expand exposure to a larger geographic population.) This is the order of the stations by size:

1. Times Sq - 42 St
1. 59 St Columbus
1. 50 St
1. 7 Ave
1. 66 St - Lincoln

Starting with the largest station, we assigned the day with the most exits, given that a specific day is not yet claimed by another station. The result is as follows, with the selected median ridership of stations by days highlighted in blue:
